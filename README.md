### Shared docs

In this directory, schedule_parts.csv, groups.csv and variables.csv represent schedule parts, repeating groups and variables found in the xml 990's.


#### Generated docs

django\_models\_auto.py and sqlalchemy\_models\_auto.py are my most current versions of relational databases that cover the tax years 2013 and fowards. The line, description and xpath shown are from the "canonical" version chosen, 2015v2.1.

These will be transformed into two csv files, one listing the variables and the other the database table details. Some details will be repeated in both files for convenience.
